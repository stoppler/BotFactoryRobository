homepage:
friendlier layout

parts:
"feels funny"
looks like a potential inventory
with an observation that the data looks fishy
friendlier layout

assembly:
"assembles" is a poor choice of name
its a parts list not a list of assembled robots
need a way to identify that
dont have any identifier for a bot
date and time stamp would be ideal
need to provide dollar value
needs to show any transaction that occurs (ex. buying, selling)

whole thing needs a consistent naming convention
poor formatting in some code
missing or inconsistent comments
